%% DATA LOADING
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Get data:
matDataBench = get_data('data', 'benchmark');
vecGdp = matDataBench(:, 1);

% Get simulated values for all models (various horizons, h):
matGdpM1_h1 = extract_paths(strFolderFc, 'benchmark', iii, 1);
matGdpM2_h1  = extract_paths(strFolderFc, 'TAR', iii, 1);

matGdpM1_h6 = extract_paths(strFolderFc, 'benchmark', iii, 6);
matGdpM2_h6 = extract_paths(strFolderFc, 'TAR', iii, 6);

matGdpM1_h12 = extract_paths(strFolderFc, 'benchmark', iii, 12);
matGdpM2_h12 = extract_paths(strFolderFc, 'TAR', iii, 12);
% NOTE: PITs and Giacomini-White test must be based on 1-step-ahead
% forecasts.

% Get simulated 1Y cumulative outturn for all models:
% % matGdpBench_cum4 = generate_cumdata(matGdpBench_1, 4) / 4;
% % matGdpAsset_cum4 = generate_cumdata(matGdpAsset_1, 4) / 4;
% % matGdpBank_cum4  = generate_cumdata(matGdpBank_1, 4)  / 4;
% % CRAP! Cannot get 1Y forecast by adding up 4 1Q forecasts done at
% different points in time! Instead, rewrite extract_paths with a "type"
% input: type=normal for current use, type=cumulative to get cum forecast

% Get cumulative 1Y observed output growth:
vecGdp_cum6  = generate_cumdata(vecGdp', 6)' / 6;
vecGdp_cum12 = generate_cumdata(vecGdp', 12)' / 12;
% Note we divide by the number of periods because GDP growth is at annual 
% rates in the data. Transpositions needed to keep data vector as a column.

% 1. Log scores (LS)
% -------------------
LS = struct;
LS.M1 = [  get_logscore(matGdpM1_h1, vecGdp, 1);
           get_logscore(matGdpM1_h6, vecGdp, 6);
           get_logscore(matGdpM1_h12, vecGdp, 12)];

LS.M2 = [  get_logscore(matGdpM2_h1, vecGdp, 1);
           get_logscore(matGdpM2_h6, vecGdp, 6);
           get_logscore(matGdpM2_h12, vecGdp, 12)];

LS.M3 = NaN * LS.M1;

LS.averages = [nanmean(LS.M1, 2)  nanmean(LS.M2, 2) nanmean(LS.M3, 2)];
% Each LS.(model) matrix is k*T, where k is the number of horizons
% considered and T is the number of forecasts. LS.averages is k*m matrix
% with the average log-score for each model (m) at each horizon (k).

% Weighted log-scores:
% ---------------------
% Get the Amisano-Giacomini (2007) weights:
vecWeightsLT = get_LS_weights(vecGdp, 'recursive', 'ltail');
vecWeightsTs = get_LS_weights(vecGdp, 'recursive', 'tails');

% Get weighted log-scores (LEFT TAIL)
matWlsLt = NaN(3,3);
dblM1h1  = nansum( LS.M1(1,:) .* vecWeightsLT' ) / sum(~isnan(LS.M1(1,:)));
dblM2h1  = nansum( LS.M2(1,:) .* vecWeightsLT' ) / sum(~isnan(LS.M2(1,:)));
dblM3h1  = NaN;
matWlsLt(1, :) = [dblM1h1 dblM2h1 dblM3h1];

% Get weighted log-scores (BOTH TAILS)
matWlsTs = NaN(3,3);
dblM1h1  = nansum( LS.M1(1,:) .* vecWeightsTs' ) / sum(~isnan(LS.M1(1,:)));
dblM2h1  = nansum( LS.M2(1,:) .* vecWeightsTs' ) / sum(~isnan(LS.M2(1,:)));
dblM3h1  = NaN;
matWlsTs(1, :) = [dblM1h1 dblM2h1 dblM3h1];
% ----------------------
% NOTE: we (1) use nansum to ignore missing LS values; and (2) divide by the
% number of actual available log-scores to get the mean (using T0 or
% maxfile is wrong, because some forecasts cannot be scored).


% 2. Prob Integral Transforms (PIT)
PIT    = struct;
PIT.M1 = get_PITs(matGdpM1_h1, vecGdp); 
PIT.M2 = get_PITs(matGdpM2_h1, vecGdp); 
PIT.M3 = []; 

% 3. Inverse-normal transform of PITs:
PITin    = struct;
PITin.M1 = icdf('Normal', PIT.M1, 0, 1);
PITin.M2 = icdf('Normal', PIT.M2, 0, 1);
PITin.M3 = [];
